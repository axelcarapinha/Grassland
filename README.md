# Programming II

## Intro
This project was made with Java, simulating an alternative version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.

Developed by me and <a href="https://github.com/davidalmarinho">David Marinho</a>. We worked on many parts of the project synchronously.
As for the other tasks, I focused on the logic and planning for the starting point, while he handled the final GUI abstraction.

The project was graded 20/20.
